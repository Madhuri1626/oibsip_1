                It is a place where nature has been in constant interaction with humans, who have shaped the environment and continue to do so.

                    But as summer comes to an end, we often forget about the beauty of nature and the simple things it has to offer.We are blessed with a lot of amazing nature around us. Of course, that's not to say that we don't depend on them for our existence. As humans, we see a connection between nature and us.
                    When we are in the outdoors, we feel better, rejuvenated. We feel more energized, relaxed, and rejuvenated.
                    When we don't spend much time outdoors, we feel less energized, relaxed, and rejuvenated.
                    We need nature to survive</p>
